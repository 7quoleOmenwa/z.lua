## Why Learn Industrial Instrumentation?
 
Industrial instrumentation is a field that involves the design, installation, maintenance and operation of instruments and systems that monitor and control industrial processes. Industrial instrumentation is essential for ensuring the safety, quality, efficiency and profitability of industrial operations. By learning industrial instrumentation, you can gain the skills and knowledge to work with various types of instruments and systems, such as:

- Pressure instruments, such as gauges, transmitters, switches and regulators
- Temperature instruments, such as thermometers, thermocouples, RTDs and pyrometers
- Flow instruments, such as meters, orifices, venturis and rotameters
- Level instruments, such as sight glasses, floats, displacers and radar
- Force, torque and velocity instruments, such as load cells, strain gauges and tachometers
- Acceleration, vibration and density instruments, such as accelerometers, piezoelectric sensors and hydrometers
- Viscosity, humidity and moisture instruments, such as viscometers, hygrometers and moisture analyzers

Industrial instrumentation also covers the topics of electronics and pneumatics instrumentation, control loops, PID control, SCADA systems and more. By learning these topics, you can understand how to use electronic components and circuits to process signals from sensors and actuators, how to use pneumatic devices to transmit power and signals using compressed air or gas, how to use feedback loops to regulate the output of a process based on a setpoint and an error signal, how to use proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controllers to adjust the output of a process based on its dynamic behavior, how to use supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems to remotely monitor and control multiple processes from a central location and more.
  
## What are the Benefits of Industrial Instrumentation?
 
Industrial instrumentation can provide many benefits for industrial operations. Some of these benefits are:

- Improved operational efficiency that reduces the potential for costly errors
- Increased automation that reduces the need for manual labor and human intervention
- Potential increased product output through optimized process conditions and parameters
- Quicker reaction time to address faults and alarms that may affect product quality or safety
- VirtuÂ­alÂ­izaÂ­tion that reduces hardware requirements while improving reliability and flexibility
- Assurance of superior performance of controls and the end-product through accurate measurement and feedback

For example, in Fullerton, California, Alcoa Fastening Systems was able to improve its wastewater treatment plant by upgrading its instrumentation and control systems. The upgrade gave operators complete control and monitoring capabilities from within the control room, alarm notification via telephone dial out, and historical data necessary for identifying the source of process problems quickly. The upgrade solved operational issues caused by burnt out lights, loose wires, lack of information in emergency situations, and no historical data collection. Alcoaâs operators were able to act proactively when issues arose and ensure compliance with environmental regulations.
